Background:
  Currently, the GNS+ Application Form retrieves employee details directly from NAMES. When section in-charges from other departments submit request for updates, mismatches in GNS+ User ID are often overlooked due to auto-populated fields. 			
  This results in incorrect entries, especially for employees who initially used the “PH” format (no APO account during requisition) but have recently created their APO accounts.

Conclusion and Judgement:
  To ensure data consistency and prevent incorrect GNS+ User IDs, the system should validate information against Tbl_Authority before retrieving details from NAMES.

Target:
  To ensure data consistency and prevent incorrect GNS+ User IDs, the system should validate information against Tbl_Authority before retrieving details from NAMES.

Proposal Details:
  This aims to improve the accuracy of employee information in the GNS+ Application Form by updating its data validation process. Currently, the system retrieves records directly from NAMES, which often results in mismatched or incorrect GNS+ User IDs, especially for employees using the “PH” format.
  The proposed change is to first check and validate employee information in Tbl_Authority before pulling details from NAMES. This adjustment will prevent overwriting valid GNS+ User IDs and ensure that accounts are reflected correctly.

Expectation of Activity:
Improve accuracy of GNS+ User IDs.

Minimize errors caused by auto-populated fields.

Ensure consistency of records with official data in Tbl_Authority.

Provide smoother request handling for departments.
