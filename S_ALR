Great — to paste as percentage with 2 decimal places, we’ll adjust the macro so that:

Values are pasted manually (not via .Value = .Value).

Format is explicitly set to Percentage with 2 decimal places.

✅ Updated Macro with Formatting as Percentage (2 Decimal Places)

Sub OpenAndCopyMultipleRangesFormatted()
    Dim folderPath As String
    Dim fileName As String
    Dim filePath As String
    Dim fileCount As Integer
    Dim wbSource As Workbook
    Dim wsSource As Worksheet
    Dim wsTarget As Worksheet

    ' Set folder path
    folderPath = "D:\Coefficient\"

    ' Locate the only .xlsx file
    fileName = Dir(folderPath & "*.xlsx")
    Do While fileName <> ""
        fileCount = fileCount + 1
        filePath = folderPath & fileName
        fileName = Dir
    Loop

    ' Check file count
    If fileCount = 0 Then
        MsgBox "No .xlsx file found in the folder.", vbExclamation
        Exit Sub
    ElseIf fileCount > 1 Then
        MsgBox "More than one .xlsx file found. Please ensure only one exists.", vbExclamation
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Open source workbook and sheets
    Set wbSource = Workbooks.Open(filePath)
    Set wsSource = wbSource.Sheets(1) ' source sheet
    Set wsTarget = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2") ' target sheet

    ' === Define Copy and Paste operations ===
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("D32:E38"), wsTarget.Range("F2")
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("F32:G38"), wsTarget.Range("F9")
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("H32:I38"), wsTarget.Range("F16")
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("H32:I38"), wsTarget.Range("F23")
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("H32:I38"), wsTarget.Range("F30")
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("H32:I38"), wsTarget.Range("F37")
    CopyAndFormat wsSource.Range("J32:K38"), wsTarget.Range("F44")

    ' Close source workbook
    wbSource.Close SaveChanges:=False

    MsgBox "All ranges copied and formatted as percentages with 2 decimals!"
End Sub

' === Helper Sub to copy values and format ===
Private Sub CopyAndFormat(srcRange As Range, tgtStartCell As Range)
    Dim r As Long, c As Long
    For r = 1 To srcRange.Rows.Count
        For c = 1 To srcRange.Columns.Count
            With tgtStartCell.Offset(r - 1, c - 1)
                .Value = srcRange.Cells(r, c).Value

            End With
        Next c
    Next r
End Sub

✅ How to Use

1. Open your .xlsm file.


2. Press Alt + F11, insert a new Module.


3. Paste the code above.


4. Press F5 or use Alt + F8 and run OpenAndCopyMultipleRangesFormatted.




---

📝 Notes:

All pasted data will be converted to percentage format with 2 decimal places, e.g., 0.25 becomes 25.00%.

If the source data is already in percentage format (like 25%), the formatting will just enforce two decimal places.


Let me know if you want to paste values only (no formulas) or ignore blank cells.

Great! Here's how to use Conditional Formatting in Excel to highlight Column H based on its value (1, 2, 3, or 4), following your logic:


---

✅ Step-by-Step: Highlight Column H Based on Value

1. Select the cells

Select the range you want to apply formatting to — for example:
H2:H50


2. Go to Conditional Formatting

Click on the Home tab → Conditional Formatting → New Rule



---

🔷 Add Rules One by One:

✅ Rule for Value = 1 (F>0%, G>0%)

1. Select: “Format only cells that contain”


2. Rule:

Cell Value → equal to → 1



3. Click Format → choose Green fill (or any color)


4. Click OK




---

✅ Rule for Value = 2 (F=0%, G>0%)

1. New Rule → “Format only cells that contain”


2. Cell Value → equal to → 2


3. Format → choose Blue fill


4. OK




---

✅ Rule for Value = 3 (F>0%, G=0%)

1. New Rule → Cell Value = 3


2. Format → Orange fill


3. OK




---

✅ Rule for Value = 4 (F=0%, G=0%)

1. New Rule → Cell Value = 4


2. Format → Red fill


3. OK




---

🎉 Result:

Now, column H will:

Green for rows where both F & G > 0

Blue for F = 0 and G > 0

Orange for F > 0 and G = 0

Red for both = 0



---

Would you like to apply similar formatting to entire rows instead of just column H?




*****
Yes! You can achieve this same logic using an Excel formula in column H, without using VBA.


---

✅ Your Logic Recap:

You want to evaluate columns F and G, and in column H, assign a value based on:

F (%)	G (%)	H (Result)

= 0.00%	> 0.00%	2
> 0.00%	= 0.00%	3
= 0.00%	= 0.00%	4
> 0.00%	> 0.00%	1



---

✅ Formula (for cell H2):

Paste this into H2, then drag it down:

=IF(AND(F2=0,G2>0),2,
 IF(AND(F2>0,G2=0),3,
 IF(AND(F2=0,G2=0),4,
 IF(AND(F2>0,G2>0),1,"")))


---

✅ Explanation:

F2 and G2 are assumed to be percentages (e.g., 0.25 = 25%)

The formula uses nested IF and AND to check all conditions.

Returns "" (blank) if none match (which shouldn't happen in your case).



---

📌 Tip:

Make sure that cells in columns F and G are numeric percentage values, not text (like "25%").

You can apply this formula from H2 down to H50 (or however many rows you're working with).


Would you like to highlight the values using conditional formatting too?

*****
Perfect! Based on your full logic for updating column H in Sheet2, here's the breakdown:


---

✅ Conditions:

Column F	Column G	Column H (Set To)

= 0.00%	> 0.00%	2
> 0.00%	= 0.00%	3
= 0.00%	= 0.00%	4
> 0.00%	> 0.00%	1



---

✅ Final VBA Code:

Sub SetValueInColumnH()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim i As Long
    Dim valF As Double
    Dim valG As Double

    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2")

    ' Loop from row 2 to 50
    For i = 2 To 50
        valF = ws.Cells(i, "F").Value
        valG = ws.Cells(i, "G").Value

        ' Apply logic based on F and G
        Select Case True
            Case valF = 0 And valG > 0
                ws.Cells(i, "H").Value = 2
            Case valF > 0 And valG = 0
                ws.Cells(i, "H").Value = 3
            Case valF = 0 And valG = 0
                ws.Cells(i, "H").Value = 4
            Case valF > 0 And valG > 0
                ws.Cells(i, "H").Value = 1
        End Select
    Next i

    MsgBox "Column H updated based on all conditions."
End Sub


---

✅ How to Use:

1. Open the VBA Editor (Alt + F11)


2. Insert a new Module if needed.


3. Paste the code.


4. Run SetValueInColumnH via Alt + F8.




---

📝 Tip:

This works best if your data in Columns F & G are numeric values formatted as percentages, not text.

If you’re copying from an external file, make sure formulas or formatting don't cause hidden issues — you can paste as values to avoid this.


Let me know if you want to extend this logic to column I → column J, etc.
