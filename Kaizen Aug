Here’s a clean “before vs. after” write‑up you can drop into a plan or SOP.

Before (As‑Is) – Step‑by‑step

1. 1st report — manual download & total

Run SAP t‑code → export to Excel.

Clean/format columns (dates, numbers).

Compute Total Value with formulas.

Save as Report1_<date>.xlsx.



2. 2nd report — pivot & template

Load raw data to a PivotTable.

Build required fields/measures.

Copy Pivot output into the Report 2 Template (fixed cells/ranges).

Save and email/upload as needed.



3. 3rd report — pivot by Section In‑Charge & template

Create a Pivot grouped by Section In‑Charge.

Filter/format per section.

Paste results into the Report 3 Template.

Save and distribute.



4. Follow‑up detail (driven by 2nd report)

From Pivot in step 2, get the list of items/keys that need detail.

Go back to SAP → download detail data.

Pivot/shape the detail.

Paste into the Detail Template and save.




Pain points: multiple manual exports, repetitive formatting, copy‑paste into templates, risk of mismatched columns and formulas.

After (To‑Be) – Step‑by‑step (simple & reliable)

Goal: Keep your same four outputs, but drive them from one “Master Workbook” with standardized SAP exports and one‑click refresh.

Prereqs (one‑time setup):

Standardize SAP exports to CSV with fixed column order & names (e.g., drop into \\Shared\SAP_Exports\YYYYMMDD\).

Build a Master Workbook with:

Power Query to import all SAP CSVs.

Three PivotTables (Report 2, Report 3 by Section, Detail).

Named ranges that map directly to each Template sheet.


Add two buttons (simple macros):

Load/Refresh Data (refreshes all queries & pivots).

Fill Templates & Save (copies values into templates and saves files with date/time stamps).



Daily run:

1. Drop files: Export the 1st SAP report (and any others needed) to the standard folder. No manual formatting.


2. Refresh: Open the Master Workbook → click Load/Refresh Data.

Power Query cleans types/headers.

Pivot for Total Value updates automatically (covers step 1’s total).



3. Report 2 (Pivot → Template): The Pivot for Report 2 is already wired to the template range.


4. Report 3 (Pivot by Section In‑Charge → Template): The section Pivot updates on refresh; template pulls from named ranges.


5. Detail (from Report 2 keys):

If detail keys are in Report 2 output, a query filters the keys list and (option A) merges with a pre‑exported SAP detail file, or (option B) uses a secondary CSV export you drop in the folder.

The Detail Pivot updates on refresh and the template fills automatically.



6. Export: Click Fill Templates & Save to write out:

Report1_TotalValue_<date>.xlsx

Report2_Summary_<date>.xlsx

Report3_Section_<date>.xlsx

Report4_Detail_<date>.xlsx (Optionally also auto‑export PDFs.)




Benefits: no manual formatting, no copy‑paste into templates, consistent totals and pivots, repeatable with two clicks.

Deliverables/Artifacts

Master Workbook (Power Query + 3 Pivots + Template sheets).

Templates: Report 2, Report 3 (Section In‑Charge), Detail.

Folder & file naming standard for SAP exports.


If you want, I can sketch the Master Workbook structure (sheets, named ranges, and the two short macros) tailored to the exact fields you have.



Update - 081425
Got it — here’s your Before and After scenario rewritten with the new Excel VBA automation process.


---

Before Scenario – Manual Process

1. 1st report – Manual download & total

Download from SAP → export to Excel.

Manually format columns.

Compute Total Value in Excel.



2. 2nd report – Pivot & template

Create a PivotTable from raw data.

Copy pivot results into the Report 2 template.



3. 3rd report – Pivot by Section In-Charge

Create a PivotTable grouped by Section In-Charge.

Paste results into the Report 3 template.



4. 4th report – From 2nd report keys → SAP detail

Get keys/items from Report 2 pivot.

Download related detail from SAP.

Create PivotTable, then paste into the Detail template.




Drawbacks:

Multiple manual downloads and formatting steps.

Repetitive copy-paste into templates.

Higher risk of errors and inconsistencies.



---

After Scenario – Automated via Excel VBA Macro

1. Open macro-enabled Excel file (contains all automation scripts).


2. Click “Generate Reports” button for each required report.


3. Macro process:

Import raw SAP exports automatically.

Apply standard formatting (headers, column widths, number formats).

Generate required PivotTables for each report.

Copy results directly into the correct report template.



4. Done — all reports are ready for review or distribution with a single click.



Benefits:

Cuts processing time from hours to minutes.

Eliminates repetitive manual formatting and copy-paste.

Ensures consistent structure and accuracy across all reports.



---

If you want, I can also create a side-by-side table so the before/after differences are easier to see at a glance. That would make it perfect for a presentation or management approval.


*****

Here’s the short version:

Before: Reports were prepared manually by downloading from SAP, formatting in Excel, creating pivots, and pasting into templates.

After: Reports are generated automatically by clicking a button in an Excel VBA macro file, which formats and fills templates instantly.

Purpose: To save time, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistent, error-free report generation.
